8. Write a shell script to check whether the file exists. If it exists, execute all the attributes.

Program:

clear
echo "Enter file name"
read fname
	if [ -e $fname ]
	then
		echo "File exists"
		if [ -r $fname ]
		then
			echo "The file is readable"
		else
			echo "The file is not readable"
		fi
		if [ -w $fname ]
		then
			echo "The file is writable"
		else
			echo "The file is not writable"
		fi

		if [ -x $fname ]
		then
			echo "The file is executable"
		else
			echo "The file is not executable"
		fi
		if [ -f $fname ]
		then
			echo "The file is an ordinary file"
		else
			echo "The file is a special file"
		fi
		if [ -d $fname ]
		then
			echo "The file is a directory"
		else
			echo "The file is not a directory"
		fi
		if [ -s $fname ]
		then
			echo "The file size is greater than 0"
		else
			echo "The file size is not greater than 0"
		fi
	else
	echo "File does not exist"
fi

Output:

	Enter file name
	/dev/tty11
	File exists
	The file is not readable
	The file is not writable
	The file is not executable
	The file is a special file
	The file is not a directory
	The file size is not greater than 0
	
		
	Enter file name
	Downloads
	File exists
	The file is readable
	The file is writable
	The file is executable
	The file is a special file
	The file is a directory
	The file size is greater than 0
